## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No databases found"
- **Make sure you shared your databases** with the integration (Step 4 above)
- Click "Refresh Databases" after sharing
- Check that you're in the right Notion workspace

### "Notion token not configured"
- Run `npm run setup` again to reconfigure
- Make sure you copied the full token (starts with `secret_`)

### "Can't find Obsidian vault path"
- The path should be the main folder containing your `.obsidian` folder
- Try creating a new vault if you're unsure
- Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows

### Conversion takes forever
- **This is normal!** Large databases (100+ pages) can take 5-10 minutes
- Watch the progress bar - it shows exactly what's happening
- Don't close the browser tab while converting

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Start small**: Try converting a small database first to test everything
- **Choose the right format**:
  - Use **Separate Pages** for detailed notes with rich content
  - Use **Dataview Table** for the best of both worlds (notes + table view)
  - Use **Markdown Table** for simple data that doesn't need individual notes
- **Organize in Obsidian**: The "Create Notion Imports folder" option keeps things tidy
- **Check your vault**: Files appear in Obsidian immediately after conversion
- **Properties become searchable**: Your Notion properties work great with Obsidian's search
- **Dataview is powerful**: If you choose the Dataview format, explore its query capabilities
- **Tables are sortable**: Click column headers in Obsidian's reading view to sort

## üÜò Need Help?

1. **Check the browser console** (F12) for detailed error messages
2. **Try a smaller database** first to test your setup
3. **Verify database sharing** - this is the most common issue
4. **Restart the app** if something seems stuck

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Your data stays local** - nothing is sent to external servers
- **Notion token is secure** - stored only on your computer
- **No data collection** - this tool doesn't track or store anything
- **Open source** - you can see exactly what it does
