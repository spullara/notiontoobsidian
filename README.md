### Example paths:

- Mac: `/Users/YourName/Documents/ObsidianVault`

## 📊 Conversion Format Options

Choose the format that best fits your Obsidian workflow:

### **1. Separate Pages (Default)**
- ✅ **Individual .md files** for each database row
- ✅ **Full content preservation** with YAML frontmatter
- ✅ **Best for detailed notes** with rich content
- ✅ **Works immediately** - no plugins required

### **2. Dataview Table + Individual Notes (Recommended)** 🌟
- ✅ **Individual notes** with rich frontmatter (same as above)
- ✅ **Master table file** with dynamic Dataview queries
- ✅ **Auto-updating table view** in Obsidian
- ✅ **Best of both worlds** - detailed notes + table overview
- ⚙️ **Requires**: [Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

### **3. Single Markdown Table (Lightweight)**
- ✅ **One table file** with all your data
- ✅ **Sortable columns** in Obsidian's reading view
- ✅ **No plugins required** - works with native Obsidian
- ✅ **Perfect for simple databases** or quick reference

### Installing the Dataview Plugin (for option 2):
1. **Open Obsidian** → Settings → Community Plugins
2. **Turn off Safe Mode** if it's enabled
3. **Click "Browse"** and search for "Dataview"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No databases found"
- **Make sure you shared your databases** with the integration (Step 4 above)
- Click "Refresh Databases" after sharing
- Check that you're in the right Notion workspace

### "Notion token not configured"
- Run `npm run setup` again to reconfigure
- Make sure you copied the full token (starts with `secret_`)

### "Can't find Obsidian vault path"
- The path should be the main folder containing your `.obsidian` folder
- Try creating a new vault if you're unsure
- Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows

### Conversion takes forever
- **This is normal!** Large databases (100+ pages) can take 5-10 minutes
- Watch the progress bar - it shows exactly what's happening
- Don't close the browser tab while converting

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start small**: Try converting a small database first to test everything
- **Choose the right format**:
  - Use **Separate Pages** for detailed notes with rich content
  - Use **Dataview Table** for the best of both worlds (notes + table view)
  - Use **Markdown Table** for simple data that doesn't need individual notes
- **Organize in Obsidian**: The "Create Notion Imports folder" option keeps things tidy
- **Check your vault**: Files appear in Obsidian immediately after conversion
- **Properties become searchable**: Your Notion properties work great with Obsidian's search
- **Dataview is powerful**: If you choose the Dataview format, explore its query capabilities
- **Tables are sortable**: Click column headers in Obsidian's reading view to sort

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Check the browser console** (F12) for detailed error messages
2. **Try a smaller database** first to test your setup
3. **Verify database sharing** - this is the most common issue
4. **Restart the app** if something seems stuck

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Your data stays local** - nothing is sent to external servers
- **Notion token is secure** - stored only on your computer
- **No data collection** - this tool doesn't track or store anything
- **Open source** - you can see exactly what it does
